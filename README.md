## About

MeetupMatcher is an app to suggest meetup groups based on a user's last 100 tweets on Twitter. It authenticates with Twitter and uses the Yelp and Meetup APIs. It was a group project completed as part of the curriculum at the [Turing School of Software & Design](http://turing.io/).

For more information about the self-directed project, visit: https://https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/feed_engine.markdown.
